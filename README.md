This repo holds extra documentation on Go's database/sql package (http://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/).
The package's documentation is kind of like a bad man page: it tells you what everything does, but it
doesn't tell you how to use the package. We find ourselves wishing for a quick-reference and a "getting started"
orientation. This repo is an attempt to provide that. Contributions are welcomed.

Go's database/sql Package
=========================

The idiomatic way to use a SQL, or SQL-like, database in Go is through the `database/sql`
package. It provides a lightweight interface to a row-oriented database. This documentation
is a reference for the most common aspects of how to use it.
